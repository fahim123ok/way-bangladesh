## 🌟 What is BanglaPath?

**BanglaPath** is not just another travel app — it's Bangladesh itself, speaking to you through AI. The country shares its stories, guides you through hidden gems, helps you navigate emergencies, and preserves your memories.

### The Innovation

Instead of a robotic "assistant that knows about Bangladesh," our AI **becomes** Bangladesh:
- Speaks in first person: "I am Bangladesh"
- Uses kaomoji for warmth: (✿◠‿◠) (★ω★) (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
- Remembers your entire conversation journey
- Provides real-time web search for visa, transport, weather updates
- Honest about challenges: monsoon floods, Dhaka traffic, rough boat rides

---

## 🎯 Real Problems We Solve

### 1. 🗺️ **Tourism Information Gap**
**Problem:** International travelers don't know where to go, what to eat, or how to get around Bangladesh.

**Solution:** 
- 112 curated places with GPS coordinates
- AI guide with contextual recommendations
- Interactive map with categories (nature, food, culture, heritage)
- Division-wise filtering (Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, etc.)

### 2. 🗣️ **Language Barrier**
**Problem:** English-only tourists struggle to communicate with Bengali-speaking locals.

**Solution:**
- Real-time Bengali ↔ English translation module
- 2000+ common phrases with pronunciation guides
- Voice input support for hands-free communication
- Quick access emergency phrases: "আমাকে সাহায্য করুন" (Help me!)

### 3. 🏥 **Healthcare Emergency Access**
**Problem:** Tourists don't know where hospitals are during medical emergencies.

**Solution:**
- **Hospital GPS Finder** with real Overpass API data
- Emergency filter (24/7 hospitals only)
- Live GPS routing to nearest facility
- Phone numbers, websites, ratings displayed
- Works globally, not just Bangladesh

### 4. 🎭 **Cultural Disconnect**
**Problem:** Generic travel apps feel cold, robotic, culturally insensitive.

**Solution:**
- Bengali-first design with RTL text support
- Cultural warmth through kaomoji and conversational AI
- Bengali time format (bn-BD locale)
- Honest, friend-like advice (not overselling)
- Tourist Police Helpline integrated: 01320-000888

### 5. 🧭 **Navigation Difficulty**
**Problem:** Bangladesh roads and routes are confusing for foreigners.

**Solution:**
- Interactive Leaflet.js map with 112 GPS pins
- Distance calculation from user location
- Category-based exploration (beaches, mountains, mosques, tea gardens)
- Visual landmark identification
